## waht`s DHCP ?



Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network protocol used to automate the process 
of configuring devices on IP networks, thus allowing them to use network services such 
as DNS, NTP, and any communication protocol based on UDP or TCP. A DHCP server dynamically 
assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network so 
they can communicate with other IP networks. DHCP is an enhancement of an older protocol called BOOTP.
